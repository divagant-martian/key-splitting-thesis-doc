  Conclusion: Open Research Problems \cite{Schneider_2013}


% What is Stream processing
  % In the recent years, the volume of data generated in different domains has
  % grown in a way that it is impossible to store and process it.\\\\

  % Stream processing was born as a solution to this problem, allowing to process
  % data incrementally without having access to all of it.\\\\

  % Instead of considering data as an static entity. Stream processing works over
  % sequences or streams of data and defines basic functions that operate over a
  % single element of one or more streams. At the same time, a function may
  % generate a new stream with its output and this stream can be fed into other


  % functions. In this way is possible to do sophisticated computations in a distributed and performant manner.\\\\


% What for is Stream Processing Useful


  % Stream processing is naturally suited for real time or near real time applications. Given its capacity to operate over partial information and produce results continuously.\\\\

% In the rest of this section we introduce some core concepts and techniques related to stream processing. The experienced reader can omit these explanations.
