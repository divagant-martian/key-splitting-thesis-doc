 \comment{What is Stream processing}
  In the recent years, the volume of data generated in different domains has
  grown in a way that it is impossible to store and process it.\\\\

  Stream processing was born as a solution to this problem, allowing to process
  data incrementally without having access to all of it.\\\\

  Instead of considering data as an static entity. Stream processing works over
  sequences or streams of data and defines basic functions that operate over a
  single element of one or more streams. At the same time, a function may
  generate a new stream with its output and this stream can be fed into other


  functions. In this way is possible to do sophisticated computations in a distributed and performant manner.\\\\

  \comment{Why/What for is Stream Processing Useful}


  Stream processing is naturally suited for real time or near real time applications. Given its capacity to operate over partial information and produce results continuously.\\\\
